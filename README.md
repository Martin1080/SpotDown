## Setup ðŸ–¥

### Requirements
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org) or newer
- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Martin1080/SpotDown/blob/main/requirements.txt)

### Setup
Download the repository zip file and extract it.

Edit the runme.txt and change 2nd line:

- `"path\to\python.exe" "path\to\app.py(this folder)"`

So the file looks for example like this:

- `@echo off
"C:\Users\Mike\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe" "C:\Mike\Documents\SpotDown\app.py"
pause`

After you replace the paths save the file as `runme.bat`

#### Congratulations, setup is done. Now you can run the `rumne.bat` file to test it! It will give you link eg. `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, just copy it and paste it to your web browser.
